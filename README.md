# Welcome to GMR, The GitHub Repository for Gerd's Lab
Today, i will teach you copy code in very few steps, you don't have to follow them perfectly, since copying and fucking around exists!

I'll update this whenever i feel like it and don't care about the new content being spoiled

- Next Update for the mod comes in May, wait a bit.
