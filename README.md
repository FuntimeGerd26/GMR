# Welcome to GMR, The GitHub Repository for Gerd's Lab
Today, i will teach you how to code in very few steps, you don't have to follow them perfectly, since copy pasting exists!

This was dead for a few months, at least 3 months, so i've revived it with a few bits of new content.

- Next Update comes on October.
